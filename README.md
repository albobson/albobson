Hi, I'm Alexander Robertson. 

I am currently a PhD at the University of Washington and just graduated with my MPH from the Yale School of Public Health.

I am mostly a hobbiest coder. I'm obsessed with the data that we generate as we interact with the world. 
I also am interested in infectious disease modeling, and evolutionary modeling of microbial communities.
