Hi, I'm Alexander Robertson. 

I am currently and MPH student at the Yale School of Public Health and starting my PhD at the University of Washington this summer.

I am mostly a hobbiest coder. I'm obsessed with the data that we generate as we interact with the world. 
I also am interested in infectious disease modeling, and evolutionary modeling of microbial communities.
